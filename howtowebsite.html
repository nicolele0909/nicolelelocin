            <h2>How to Inhale</h2>
            <img src="kirbyinhaling.png" alt="Kirby inhaling" style="width:400px; height:279;">
            <p>As simple as it sounds, inhaling might be a challenge when your body and head decide that they are too tired for the simple act. If anxiety and nervousness make it easy for your body to function improperly and your mind to be clouded with doubt, your lungs––and your heart––are telling you to breathe in as deeply as possible.</p>
            <p>Taking in a sufficient amount of oxygen helps your body and mind more aware and alert. Consequently, this is one of the most basic functions of the human activity that is also included in yawning. According to <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/kids/yawn.html" target="_blank">Dr. Gupta from KidsHealth.org</a>, yawning helps us bring more oxygen into the blood. Inhaling oxygen is an inevitable process in aiding our blood circulation working efficiently.</p>
            <p>In addition, oxygen is an essential element in respiration. Without O<sub>2</sub>, energy from the release of food production consumed would be stored permanently. Lungs take in oxygen for the combustion of food, helping release carbon dioxide from blood.</p>
            <p>Take your time, clear your head, and take in the largest amount of oxygen in your life. You can feel the sense of breeze brush against the tips of your nostrils as the oxygen flows into your system––and into your blood. To help the process more manageable, imagine yourself standing in your favorite place, being your bedroom or Niagara Falls, with your eyes shut. Visualizing yourself absorb all of the energy and aroma from the place would certainly help guide your way through if you have problem focusing.</p>

            <h2>How to Exhale</h2>

            <p>Exhaling is easy just like that; however, according to Alex Russo in <i>Wizards of Waverly Place</i>: "Everything is not what it seems." When in doubt, just remember that taking out CO<sub>2</sub> is as important as taking in O<sub>2</sub>. As you breathe out a certain amount of carbon dioxide, the respiratory cycle contributes tremendously to the adjustment of the pH level in your body. Unlike aerobic organisms such as octopus, mammals, including human beings, need oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of their system.</p>
            <p>To calm your breathing down, after you have absorbed all the oxygen possible either through your nostrils or mouth, release the compressed air in your lungs. You can also apply the instruction above from inhaling to your exhaling exercise. As you envision yourself in somewhere comfortable and familiar enough to pacify your mind and body, you can relax into the exhaling.</p>

            <p>While breathing, there might be more than one factor affecting your complete concentration. Not only can extraneous factors disrupt your process, but you can yourself unintentionally.
